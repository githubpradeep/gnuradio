\section Introduction

This is the gr-ctroport package. It is a tool to create distributed
contol applications for GNU Radio. It provides blocks that can be
connected to an output stream to plot the signal remotely. It also
provides an API that allows blocks to export variables that can be
set, monitored, and plotted remotely.

The Python namespace is in gnuradio.ctrlport, which would be normally
imported as:

\code
    from gnuradio import ctrlport
\endcode


See the Doxygen documentation for details about the blocks available
in this package. A quick listing of the details can be found in Python
after importing by using:

\code
    help(ctrlport)
\endcode

\section Dependencies

ControlPort requires ZeroC's ICE and associated
libraries/headers/programs. ICE is generally installed into the
standard paths if using a software repo (like apt-get, yum, etc.). If
installed by hand, GNU Radio assumes ICE is installed into
/opt/Ice-3.4.2. If this is not the case, you can tell GNU Radio where
to find ICE by passing to cmake the following:

    -DICE_MANUAL_INSTALL_PATH=<your path here>
